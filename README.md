# Web Development Project 2 - *Flashcards App*

Submitted by: **Hotragn Pettugani**

This web app: **A responsive web application built with React that allows users to study flashcards in a randomized order. The app displays questions and answers on cards, enabling users to flip between them and navigate through the card set.**

Time spent: **8** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] **The title of the card set and some information about it, such as a short description and the total number of cards are displayed**
- [x] **A single card at a time is displayed, only showing one of the components of the information pair**
- [x] **A list of card pairs is created**
- [x] **Clicking on the card shows the corresponding component of the information pair**
- [x] **Clicking the next button displays a random new card**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Cards contain images in addition to or in place of text
- [ ] Cards have different visual styles such as color based on their category
- [ ] *Green background for plant-related cards implemented*

The following **additional** features are implemented:

## Notes

### Challenges Encountered

During development, several technical challenges were addressed:

- **State Management:**  
  Implementing the flipping functionality required careful state management to toggle between question and answer.

- **Randomized Navigation:**  
  Ensuring that clicking "Next" displayed a truly random card without repeating the same one consecutively.

- **Background Image Implementation:**  
  Adding a plant-themed background image presented challenges with proper sizing and ensuring text readability.

- **Responsive Design:**  
  Creating a layout that adapts seamlessly across different device sizes involved using CSS flexbox along with media queries.

- **Visual Styling:**  
  Ensuring smooth animations for flipping cards while maintaining consistent styling across categories.
